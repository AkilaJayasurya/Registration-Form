# Registration-Form

ðŸ‘¤Registration Form

I created a clean and responsive registration form using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
The form includes input fields for Name, Email, and Password, with real-time validation.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Modern and minimal UI with Tailwind styling
Error messages displayed if any field is left empty or filled incorrectly
Basic validation for correct email format and password requirements
Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
Smooth user experience with instant feedback
This is a perfect starting point for login/registration flows in any web project! ðŸš€
